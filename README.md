# The Hanged Man
## Description
Introducing The Hanged Man, a modern twist on the classic word-guessing challenge! This application is a Hangman-style game inspired by the Hanged Man from the Major Arcana of the Tarot Deck and is available for anyone to play and enjoy. 
During the game, a user can guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time for the chance to win the game upon guessing all letters in the word correctly. Each incorrect guess inches the hangman closer to death, adding a suspenseful layer to every decision you make. 
This application goes beyond the traditional, offering many features to enhance your gaming experience. Choose from a range of difficulty levels, from novice to expert, to suit your skill level. Immerse yourself in various themes that bring a fresh aesthetic to the classic gameplay, and let the sound effects heighten the tension as you race against the hangman's creation.
